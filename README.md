#Zomato-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

Problem Statement:
Zomato is a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery services.

Data analysis on the platform's data could be used to gain insights into customer preferences and behavior, as well as identify trends in the restaurant industry.

data visualization can be used to effectively communicate the insights from Zomato data analysis to a wide range of stakeholders, including restaurants, food industry players, and investors.

Data Engineering:
On studying the dataset I observed certain wrong information.
For the country Philippines(country code = 162) the currency is Philippines peso but in the dataset it was given as Botswana pula

The mistake was corrected.
And also converting other countryâ€™s currency to INR.

Insights:

Zomato is doing pretty well in India in terms of restaurant counts.

The company has to concentrate on building its business in other countries.
